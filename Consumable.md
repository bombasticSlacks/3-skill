# Consumable
Covers any type of gear that is destroyed or made useless by using. The act of using a consumable destroys it. Medicine, drugs, potions, salves and other quick solutions to big problems. Usually takes an action to be ingested and then has a notable effect. 

## Alchemy
Alchemy, otherwise known as pharmacy, is the act of preparing plants, animal bits, and other sources of compounds for consumption. These alchemical mixtures will usually have positive effects, but poisons can potentially be crafted.

Remember that Aspirant is a magical world and medicine should be similarly magical. Even compounds resembling real-world effects should work faster, with less side effects, and provide more effective solutions.

## Food
Needed to survive. etc. etc.
