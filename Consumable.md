# Consumable
Covers any type of gear that is destroyed or made useless by using. The act of using a consumable destroys it. There are a few specialized categories of consumable:
#### Munitions
Weapons with a [Capacity](Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X,%20Type)) will require munitions of some kind. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons.

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage](Game/Core/Terminology#Damage).

#### Throwables
A less sophisticated solution to ranged attacks, sometimes weapons or items are designed to be thrown. 

As with [Ammunition](#Ammunition), specialized throwables exist either with larger damage bonuses, specialized effects or changed damage type.

#### Ingested and Applied
Medicine, drugs, potions, salves and other quick solutions to big problems. Usually takes an action to be ingested and then has a notable effect. 

#### Food
Needed to stay alive. Every day a person needs to ingest 1 size worth of food.

## SCRATCH
Food 3 tiers (basic, artisan, exotic) - basic gain a stress, if you eat artisan no stress, if you eat exotic you get a stress back. Masterwork gives a trait from ingested and applied.

Munitions are costed per type. So arrows are basic, bolts are artisan, lead balls are exotic. You can add modifiers by crafting a higher tier of the thing. So flaming arrows are artisan. piercing bolts are exotic. Modified bullets would need to be masterworked. Exotic munitions require special training like weapons. 

Potions and such are based on their effect. Need to make a listâ€¦
