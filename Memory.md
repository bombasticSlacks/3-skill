# Memory

The action of learning and remembering things about the world around you, making causal connections, getting additional details. This includes:
* Recalling advanced knowledge from a trained discipline.
* Knowing something that you could realistically know.
* Memorizing something complex under pressure.

Any time you are looking to call on your knowledge, you should make a memory [[Skills|Skill]] test.
