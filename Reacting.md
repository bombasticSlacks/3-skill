# Reacting

Sometimes when something happens, you wish you could have done something differently to avoid or responded sooner. This is what [Reactions](Game/Blocks/Core/Reactions) are for, allowing you to react to things as they happen. Any time you want to react to something that is currently happening, you may spend a [Reaction](Game/Blocks/Core/Reaction). You cannot react to a reaction.

## Narrative Reactions

Any time you would like to interrupt an ongoing action, you may spend a [Reaction](Game/Blocks/Core/Reaction) to do so.

> If someone had just pulled a lever to lower a drawbridge, you could spend a reaction to attack them before they can do it, hopefully, leaving the bridge up.

## Combat Reactions

Combat provides additional ways to react, some obvious ones are below.

### Avoid

If an [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) performs a [Successful Attack](Terminology#Successful%20Attack), you may perform a [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0). If you succeed, you ignore the effects of the attack unless otherwise specified.

### Move to Cover

A [Coordination](Agility#Coordination) skill test where if you succeed then you may move to a piece of cover within [Reach](Movement#Reach) before an enemy ranged attack is calculated. You cannot Move to Cover while [Prone](Effects#Prone).
