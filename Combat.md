# Combat
Combat is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat will still naturally flow between the players and the GM performing actions; however, there are some structures on [Action Order](#Action%20Order) during combat to keep things fair.


## Action Order
During combat, though many events happen simultaneously in a game, we need to do them in a sequence. This sequence is concerned with two primary issues, [Who Goes First](#Who%20Goes%20First) and [Who Goes Next](#Who%20Goes%20Next)?

### Who Goes First
The first [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) to act in combat is always the first [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) to perform a hostile action. 

If someone wants to perform something hostile and someone else is aware and able to stop them, the player does a [Reflexes](Game/Core/Agility#Reflexes) [Opposed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Reflexes](Game/Core/Agility#Reflexes)) test. If they succeed, they act first, otherwise the target does.

### Who Goes Next
After any action in combat, the next character to act should be from the other group of [Player Characters](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character) and the [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master).

> So if a GM controlled soldier attacks a player's character, the next character to act should be player controlled.

#### Guidelines
* If possible, a single [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) cannot take repeat turns for their team.
* A player who was just the [Opponent](Game/Core/Terminology#Opponent) of an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) should get the first opportunity to perform an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) if they have something in mind.

#### Followers
 If a character has [Follower](Game/Core/Terminology#Follower) they may be selected to act instead of a [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character).

#### Overwhelming Odds
If the players or the non-players meaningfully outnumber each other one way or another, then the side with the larger numbers can take two actions in a row before the other team gets to respond to represent the swarm of people.

## Threat
A measure of how dangerous and threatening a person is. Used to weight who unintelligent monsters target at random as well as makes it harder to fight with ranged weapons when [In Melee](Effects#In%20Melee).
* A character that is unarmed still has a base threat of 1. 
* A character that is unconscious or otherwise detained should have a threat of 0.
