# Combat
Combat is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat is broken up into [Combat Rounds](#Combat%20Round). 

## Combat Round
In combat, a combat round is all the actions of every [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) in that combat. When everyone has taken a combat turn, the combat round is over and if there are still hostile characters aware of one another, a new combat round starts. If it is important for some reason, a combat round usually encompasses 5 seconds of time, but shouldnâ€™t be dwelled on too specifically unless necessary.

At the start of combat, every active participant should compute an [Initiative Value](#Initiative%20Value) which will determine the order they act.

During each combat round, all [Characters](Game/Core/Terminology#Character):
* Get a [Combat Turn](Combat-Turn) where you can perform an [Action](Terminology#Action).
* Get a [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction) used for [Reacting](Reacting).

## Initiative Value
A [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) test, where your [Step](Skills#Step) value is compared to everyone else's. Your initiative value determines what order people will perform their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) during the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round). So even though all characters are acting simultaneously in combat, as an abstraction, people still go in a specific order.

> So if you are fighting someone, you both perform a [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) test. You get a 13 meaning 3 [Step Of Success](Skills#Step), they get a 8 meaning 2 steps of failure. That means you act first in the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round).
