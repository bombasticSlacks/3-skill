# Combat
Combat is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat will still naturally flow between the players and the GM performing actions; however, there are some structures on [[#Action Order|Action Order]] during combat to keep things fair.


## Action Order
During combat, though many events happen simultaneously in a game, we need to do them in a sequence. This sequence is concerned with two primary issues, [[#Who Goes First|Who Goes First]] and [[#Who Goes Next|Who Goes Next]]?

### Who Goes First
The first [[Terminology#Character]] to act in combat is always the first [[Terminology#Character]] to perform a hostile action. 

If someone wants to perform something hostile and someone else is aware and able to stop them, the player does a [[Reflexes]] [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] test. If they succeed, they act first, otherwise the target does.

### Who Goes Next
After any action in combat, the next character to act should be from the other group of [[Terminology#Player Character]] and the [[Terminology#Game Master]].

> So if a GM controlled soldier attacks a player's character, the next character to act should be player controlled.

#### Guidelines
* If possible, a single [[Terminology#Character]] cannot take repeat turns for their team.
* A player who was just the [[Terminology#Opponent]] of an [[Terminology#Action]] should get the first opportunity to perform an [[Terminology#Action]] if they have something in mind.

#### Followers
 If a character has [[Terminology#Follower]] they may be selected to act instead of a [[Terminology#Player Character]].

#### Overwhelming Odds
If the players or the non-players meaningfully outnumber each other one way or another, then the side with the larger numbers can take two actions in a row before the other team gets to respond to represent the swarm of people.

## Threat
A measure of how dangerous and threatening a person is. Used to weight who unintelligent monsters target at random as well as makes it harder to fight with ranged weapons when [[In-Melee]].
* A character that is unarmed still has a base threat of 1. 
* A character that is unconscious or otherwise detained should have a threat of 0.

## Defending
When a [[Terminology#Player Character]] is attacked they will need to defend themselves. This is a [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] skill test with a penalty and skill based on the attack.
