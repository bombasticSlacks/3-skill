## Effects
Effects are temporary things that can be applied to a character. They will effect your [Action](Terminology#Action) and the [Action](Terminology#Action) of others.

### Stunned
A stunned character cannot perform [Action](Terminology#Action) or move.

### Unconscious
A character that can no longer fight is considered unconscious. This might consist of having to put pressure on wounds, being in shock, actually being unconscious, or any number of narrative appropriate scenarios. A character who is considered unconscious skips their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn), and has a [Threat](Stats#Threat) of 0. They remain in this state until the end of combat, and potentially longer if narratively appropriate.

### On Fire
*Your character or their clothing is currently burning.* 
If you are caught on fire, you are at immediate risk of severe complications. On each of your turns, unless you are already trying to put yourself out you must make an [Identity](Spirit#Identity) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) skill test to not panic, which means you become [Stunned](#Stunned) for the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round). You receive a (+4) to this test if you are going to try to put yourself out during your turn.

* After 2 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) of being on fire, you take an immediate [Severe Injury](#Severe%20Injury). 
* After 4 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) you take a [Critical Injury](Injury#Critical%20Injury). 
* After 6 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) on fire you take a [Critical Injury](Injury#Critical%20Injury) to the chest on each of your [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) until either dead or no longer on fire.

To put yourself out is an [Application](Intelligence#Application) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(-3). If you succeed you are no longer on fire. For each consecutive turn, you have been putting yourself out, you receive a (+1) to the [Action](Terminology#Action).

### Prone
Your character is on the ground. They suffer a -2 to all [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill tests, cannot perform [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction).

To stop being prone in combat you perform a [Grace](Agility#Grace) [Fixed Difficulty(0)](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty):
* If you succeed you may stand as a [Free Action](Terminology#Free%20Action)
* If you fail you may stand as a [Free Action](Terminology#Free%20Action) but cannot move during this [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round)

### Slowed
A slowed character can only move up to [Close](Movement#Close) on their next turn.

### In Melee
*Your character moves around and connects weapons with combatants.*
* If a character in melee moves to something further than in [Reach](Movement#Reach), others may perform [Attack of Opportunity](Reacting-To-Attacks#Attack%20of%20Opportunity) against them.
* Characters in melee suffer a negative to attacks equal to the greatest [Threat](Stats#Threat) among [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) within [Reach](Movement#Reach) and also in melee.
* Characters in melee effect being [Outnumbered](Attack-Bonuses#Outnumbered).
* To stop being in melee, there must be no other combatants in melee within [Reach](Movement#Reach).

### In Cover
*You are partially, or totally, obfuscated from your opponent.*

If you are behind cover and not attacking or otherwise doing something it is assumed, you are fully covered. Anyone shooting at you gets a -2 as you are not visible, and your entire body is protected by the cover.

If you are shooting from behind cover unless you have some special abilities you require your dominant arm chest and head exposed. When you are shot when you determine hit location if any of those locations are targeted you are hit normally otherwise your cover protects you. You may opt to blind fire while in cover which is a ranged attack at -4 but only requires your dominant arm to be outside cover.

You do not gain the benefits of cover if you are in melee.

If you are protected by cover, any attack against you must first penetrate the cover to be able to harm you (this stacks with your armour). Most pieces of cover only have 1 armour integrity and will be unable to protect you after the first shot.
