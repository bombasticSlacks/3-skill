# Movement
Specifics of measurement, distance and the idea of "movement speed", are simplified. Instead of a movement speed, usually it is assumed your character can make it to where they want to go, the question is how rushed will you be when you get there.

## Distance Increments
Generally, when you are getting ready to do an action and plan to move towards something, there are 5 distances it can be from you:

### Reach
The location is within reach. Your immediate area.

### Close
The location is nearby, basically anyone could make it there without too much trouble.

### Short
The location is a short travel distance, it would be a challenge for most people to get there quickly. 

### Far
The location is far off, even a very fast person would struggle to get to it quickly.

### Impossible
The location isn't reachable in a timely manner. You should instead try to move towards it, but more narrative work needs to be done to get to it. 

As a [[Terminology#Game Master]] try to avoid making situations and locations where things are impossible to reach. Impossible should also include suggestions for more approachable milestones.

### Approximating Distance
Distances shouldn't be set in stone, it should be flexible based on your characters' movement and the timescale of the current events. However, the following guidelines are provided.

| Name       | Approximate Distance |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| [[#Reach]]      | $< 3m$               |
| [[#Close]]      | $\approx 10m$        |
| [[#Short]]      | $\approx 20m$        |
| [[#Far]]        | $\approx 40m$        |
| [[#Impossible]] | $> 50m$              |

## Movement Action Penalty
When you are expected to travel to a location and immediately perform an action, like when in [[Combat]], or otherwise pressured, any action you take may be at a penalty.

Your movement action penalty is equal to the number distance increments you need to travel.

> So if you were to move [[#Close|Close]] you would suffer a (-1) to an action, [[#Far|Far]] would be a (-3).

There is no movement action penalty for [[#Impossible|Impossible]] because it isn't possible to arrive there. The character must spend some time in transit before making it, any action penalty would be based on their intermediate destination.

## Avoiding Obstacles
If there are obstacles in the way of a movement, you may need to perform an [[Terminology#Action]] to avoid it.
