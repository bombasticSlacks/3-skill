# Connection

The act of connecting with other people and creatures, and making them do what you want. This includes:
* Convincing someone to help you.
* Getting a good deal on a trade.
* Seeing if someone trusts you enough to share useful information.
* Calming an animal.

Any time you are communicating and need to see if you've connected with the other entity, you should make a connection [[Skills|Skill]] test.
