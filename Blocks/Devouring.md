### Devouring
*This otherworldly weapon feeds off those it destroys.*
* When this weapon causes [[Effects#Defeated]] or kills an enemy, it refreshes all [[#Capacity(X, Type|Capacity]]) if it has any, otherwise the defeated [[Terminology#Character]] life force is stored within the weapon for other uses.
