### Capacity(X, Type)
*This weapon requires [[Munitions]] to be used.*
* The number and types of things that this item can be loaded with to be used. Usually written as Capacity (X, Type), which means it can be used X times, and is loaded with Type item.
* If a weapon doesn't specify otherwise you can refill its capacity as an [[Terminology#Action]].

> So a weapon described as having Capacity(12, Fuel) would hold 12 Fuel.
