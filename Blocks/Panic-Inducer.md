## Panic Inducer
*A concoction making a person see nothing but fear and flee.*
* As a [[Consumable#Result]] the [[Consumable#Target]] must run from the [[Consumable#Applicant]] and cannot willingly approach them. They will only perform [[Terminology#Action]] if it helps them get away. This effect lasts until the end of the [[Terminology#Scene]].
