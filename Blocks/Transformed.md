* You cannot use abilities other than those provided by the [NPC Attributes](Game/Core/Characters#NPC%20Attributes).

{: no_toc }
* Removed by disrupting the source of the transformation.
* Removed when you go to 0 [Integrity](Game/Core/Characters#Integrity) (this reverts your integrity to whatever it was prior to transformation).
