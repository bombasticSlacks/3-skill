* Characters in melee suffer a negative to [Ranged Attack](Terminology#Ranged%20Attack) equal to the greatest [Threat](Attributes#Threat) among [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) within [Reach](Movement#Reach) and also in melee.
* If your [Allies](Game/Core/Terminology#Ally) are greater than enemies in melee you receive a (+1) to all [Attack](Game/Core/Terminology#Attack).
