* Characters in melee suffer a negative to [[Terminology#Ranged Attack]] equal to the greatest [[Attributes#Threat]] among [[Terminology#Opponent]] within [[Movement#Reach]] and also in melee.
* If your [[Terminology#Ally]] are greater than enemies in melee you receive a (+1) to all [[Terminology#Attack]].
