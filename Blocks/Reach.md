### Reach
*This weapon is long enough that you can fight people without them being close to you.*
* Performing [Melee Attack](Terminology#Melee%20Attack) doesn't put you [In Melee](Effects#In%20Melee). You contribute to [Outnumbered](Attack-Bonuses#Outnumbered) for anyone in [Reach](Movement#Reach).
