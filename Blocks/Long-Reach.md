### Long Reach
*This weapon is long enough that you can fight people without them being close to you.*
* When you are [In Melee](Game/Core/Effects#In%20Melee) with an [Ally](Game/Core/Terminology#Ally) you cannot be targeted with attacks from enemies also [In Melee](Game/Core/Effects#In%20Melee), and you can leave melee without getting attacked.
