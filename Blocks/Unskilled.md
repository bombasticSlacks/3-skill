### Unskilled
Gear that doesn't require skill to operate will be marked with "unskilled". It is assumed most gear will otherwise still require you to perform a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) of some kind. Generally, gear facilitates or aids with actions that would otherwise be impossible, it doesn't make them guaranteed. Even gear marked as unskilled may, if used in unorthodox ways, still require a skill test.

> Feeding someone medicine doesn't require a skill test, but modifying it with other medicines and tools would even if the medicine is marked as "unskilled".
