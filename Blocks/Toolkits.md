### Toolkits
Toolkits are a type of gear that abstracts a collection of tools necessary for a certain activity meaning a character doesn't need to be as concerned with tracking really specific items on their character sheet. This doesn't mean a character with a *specific* item can't do a skill test or action with a specific item that they've obtained narratively just that a tool kit would have made it much easier.
