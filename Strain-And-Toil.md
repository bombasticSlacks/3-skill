# Strain And Toil
Everyone has a limit to how much they can take before they can't push themselves any further. [[Stress]] is how this is tracked.

## Gaining Stress
Depending on the scope of the character something may or may not be stressful. A hardboiled investigator might be used to seeing the dead, whereas a baker may not be. Stress can be assigned:
* When a character fails an [[Strength#Endurance]] test related to something mind effecting.
* A character finds themselves in the face of something terrifying.
* When a characters mind or body are ravaged by hunger, cold, exhaustion.
* When a character fails a [[Terminology#Skill Test]] they may suffer [[Stress]] but move forward. As an example, maybe the character fails an athletics skill test to jump over a cliff, instead of having them fall to their death, they could be assigned a [[Stress]] and be left precariously dangling. 

Similar to [[Reaction]] or [[Power]], [[Stress]] can be offered as a resource to spend. When a character pushes themselves out of their comfort zone suggest they may complete the action or make a skill test if they take [[Stress]].

When a character has [[Stress]] equal to their max [[Stress]] they [[#Boil Over]]. If a character at their max [[Stress]] would gain [[Stress]] they don't and instead just [[#Boil Over]].

## Boil Over
When a character has [[Stress]] equal to their max [[Stress]] they boil over. The simplest effect of boiling over is that a character is [[Defeated]]. However the [[Terminology#Game Master]] may assign an alternate effect, or the effected [[Terminology#Player Character]] may suggest something appropriate. When you boil over, reduce your [[Stress]] by 1. As part of the act of boiling over you cannot gain additional [[Stress]].

## Needs
Everyday a character unless otherwise specified needs access to clean water, a night of sleep, and 1 [[Food]]. If any of these needs are not met the character gains 1 [[Stress]].
