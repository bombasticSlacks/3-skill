## NPC Types
Easy to build, simplification of character design. Instead of using skills, these characters have specific actions and traps they can perform, as well as a smaller selection of traits. There are three tiers of simple NPC, mostly designed for direct party challenges: [[#Fodder|Fodder]], [[#Elites|Elites]], [[#Bosses|Bosses]].

### Fodder
Weak characters, they should have: 
* 1-2 [[#Actions|Actions]] they can perform.
* Maybe some [[#Traits|Traits]]
* 0 [[#Integrity|Integrity]], any amount of damage will defeat them.

### Elites
Characters similarly powerful to the player characters with multiple interesting things they can do. They should have:
* Fully populated [[#NPC Attributes|NPC Attributes]].
* Multiple [[#Actions|Actions]].
* Any number of [[#Traits|Traits]].
* Potentially a few [[#Traps|Traps]].
* When Elites go to 0 [[#Integrity|Integrity]] they are defeated.

### Bosses
Characters that could occupy multiple party members with lots of things they can do. They should have:
* Fully populated [[#NPC Attributes|NPC Attributes]].
* Multiple [[#Actions|Actions]].
* Any number of [[#Traps|Traps]].
* Any number of [[#Traits|Traits]].
* The [[Boss]] trait.
