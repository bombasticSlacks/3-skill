# Characters
{: .no_toc }

All characters that aren't a [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character), still need rules for the players to engage with. Non player characters are generally just a collection of actions, reactions, traits and some default details.
Non player characters come in 2 overall archetypes: [Simple NPCs](#Simple%20NPCs) and [Complex NPCs](#Complex%20NPCs).

## Simple NPCs
Easy to build, simplification of character design. Instead of using skills, these characters have specific actions and reactions they can perform, as well as a smaller selection of attributes and traits. There are three tiers of simple NPC, mostly designed for direct party challenges: [Fodder](#Fodder), [Elites](#Elites), [Bosses](#Bosses).

### Fodder
Weak characters that have no [Armour Integrity](Armour#Armour%20Integrity), few [Action](Terminology#Action) and be incapable of [Reacting](Game/Core/Reacting). Any damage will defeat them, and they will tend to only do one thing.

### Elites
Characters similarly powerful to the player characters. They should have [Armour Integrity](Armour#Armour%20Integrity), be capable of [Reacting](Game/Core/Reacting), and have multiple [Action](Terminology#Action). If an elite enemy is [Wounded](Effects#Wounded) they are immediately [Defeated](Effects#Defeated).

### Bosses
#TODOCombat
Characters that could occupy multiple party members. They are capable of [Reacting](Game/Core/Reacting), and should be incapable of suffering [Overwhelming Odds](Game/Core/Combat#Overwhelming%20Odds). They should also have [Resistance(X)](Character-Actions#Resistance(X)) allowing them to survive potentially lethal strikes like a player character. 

## Complex NPCs
For significant NPCs that will interact in very meaningful ways with the players. Complex NPCs come in two categories: [Archetypes](#Archetypes) and [Full](#Full).

### Archetypes
A collection of values that would approximate many characters with suggested values for the NPCs skill tests. This allows you to quickly get consistent NPCs up and running in your games.

### Full
Follow the general rules of [Character-Creation](Character-Creation). They have [Attributes](Attributes), [Gear](Gear), [Skills](Skills) and training either from the standard lists or specialized ones.
