## On Fire
*Your character or their clothing is currently burning.* 
If you are caught on fire, you are at immediate risk of severe complications. On each of your turns, unless you are already trying to put yourself out you must make an [Identity](Spirit#Identity) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) skill test to not panic, which means you become [Stunned](#Stunned) for the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round). You receive a (+4) to this test if you are going to try to put yourself out during your turn.

* After 2 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) of being on fire, you take an immediate [Severe Injury](#Severe%20Injury). 
* After 4 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) you take a [Critical Injury](Injury#Critical%20Injury). 
* After 6 [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round) on fire you take a [Critical Injury](Injury#Critical%20Injury) to the chest on each of your [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) until either dead or no longer on fire.

To put yourself out is an [Application](Intelligence#Application) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(-3). If you succeed you are no longer on fire. For each consecutive turn, you have been putting yourself out, you receive a (+1) to the [Action](Terminology#Action).
