# Attacking
Usually, in combat, you will be trying to harm your opponents with the goal of killing or disabling them. Attacks will typically be:
* Thrown attacks using [Physique](Strength#Physique)
* Ranged attacks using [Coordination](Agility#Coordination)
* Melee attacks using [Physique](Strength#Physique) 
* Magic attacks using [Ascendancy](Game/Core/Intuition#Ascendancy)

## Attack Range
When you attack something, your range is how far you can engage them from. 
* If a weapon doesn't specify a range it is assumed you need to be within [Reach](Movement#Reach).
* If you aren't within a weapons range you can either [Move](Game/Core/Movement), or suffer a [Distance Penalty](Attack-Bonuses#Distance%20Penalty), or perhaps, both.
* Magic generally has a range of [Close](Movement#Close).
* Items can be thrown [Close](Movement#Close).
* Ranged attacks will be defined in the weapons [traits](Weapons#[Weapon-Traits](Weapon-Traits)).

## Attacking
- Declare what weapon you are using
- Make sure you are within range (or figure out what your total penalty will be) 
- Determine any bonuses or negatives you have on the attack.
- Declare any modifiers you are applying to the attack.
- Roll a skill test. If you fail this test, this is a [Mitigated Attack](Terminology#Mitigated%20Attack).
- Your [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) can use a [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction).
- Your [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) [Takes Damage](#Taking%20Damage)

## Critical Hits
If an [Attack](Terminology#Attack) is a [Critical Success](Skills#Critical%20Success) it deals +1 [Damage](Terminology#Damage).

## Combat Modifiers
These are modifiers you can apply to attacks and manoeuvres which will put you at a negative to the skill test but will make the attack or manoeuvre do additional things. Several other powerful modifiers can be learned by taking specific combat training.Â 

### Extra Damage
*Action modifier varies*

Your [Attack](Terminology#Attack) does additional [Damage](Terminology#Damage). Every weapon wielded by a character will have a different [Extra Damage Modifier](Game/Core/Weapons#Extra%20Damage%20Modifier).

### Called Attack
*Action modifier (-2) but may vary*
Your [Attack](Terminology#Attack) strikes a specific point of interest on an enemy. 
* An [Attack](Terminology#Attack) that rolls [Doubles](Skills#Doubles), is always considered a called attack.
* Called attacks consider [Critical Weakness](Game/Core/Armour#Critical%20Weakness).
* Called attacks cause 2 additional [Injury Damage](Game/Core/Injury#Injury%20Damage), if they cause any.
* Any other narrative effects based on the details of the attack. 
* A called attack **cannot** be used to circumvent [Armour Integrity](Game/Core/Armour#Armour%20Integrity).


## Taking Damage
If you fail to mitigate an incoming attack, you will take damage.
[Armour](Armour) is your first line of defence against attacks. Your armour provides you with a small amount of [Armour Integrity](Armour#Armour%20Integrity) which can absorb incoming damage. 

* Adjust incoming damage based on if you have [Weakness and Resistance](Armour#Weakness%20and%20Resistance) to the attack.
* Deduct incoming damage from your [Armour Integrity](Armour#Armour%20Integrity).
* Any remaining damage is converted to [Injury](Injury).

> Example, if your character takes 3 damage from a piercing attack while wearing armour weak to piercing with 2 [Armour Integrity](Armour#Armour%20Integrity). Your character's Armour Integrity is reduced to 0, with 3 damage still left unaccounted for, you suffer 3 [Injury Damage](Game/Core/Injury#Injury%20Damage).
