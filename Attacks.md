# Attacking
Usually, in combat, you will be trying to harm your opponents with the goal of killing or disabling them. Attacks will typically be:
* Thrown attacks using [[Strength#Physique]]
* Ranged attacks using [[Agility#Coordination]]
* Melee attacks using [[Strength#Physique]] 
* Magic attacks using [[Instinct#Ascendancy]]

## Attack Range
When you attack something, your range is how far you can engage them from. 
* If a weapon doesn't specify a range it is assumed you need to be within [[Movement#Reach]].
* If you aren't within a weapons range you can either [[Movement|Move]], or suffer a [[Attack-Bonuses#Distance Penalty]], or perhaps, both.
* Magic generally has a range of [[Movement#Close]].
* Items can be thrown [[Movement#Close]].
* Ranged attacks will be defined in the weapons [[Weapon-Traits]]|[Weapons#[Weapon-Traits]].

## Attacking
- Declare what weapon you are using
- Make sure you are within range (or figure out what your total penalty will be) 
- Determine any bonuses or negatives you have on the attack.
- Declare any modifiers you are applying to the attack.
- Roll a skill test. If you fail this test, this is a [[Terminology#Mitigated Attack]].
- Your [[Terminology#Opponent]] can use a [[Terminology#Reaction]].
- Your [[Terminology#Opponent]] [[#Taking Damage|Takes Damage]]

## Critical Hits
If an [[Terminology#Attack]] is a [[Skills#Critical Success]] it deals +1 [[Terminology#Damage]].

## Combat Modifiers
These are modifiers you can apply to attacks and manoeuvres which will put you at a negative to the skill test but will make the attack or manoeuvre do additional things. Several other powerful modifiers can be learned by taking specific combat training.Â 

### Extra Damage
*Action modifier varies*

Your [[Terminology#Attack]] does additional [[Terminology#Damage]]. Every weapon wielded by a character will have a different [[Weapons#Extra Damage Modifier]].

### Called Attack
*Action modifier (-2) but may vary*
Your [[Terminology#Attack]] strikes a specific point of interest on an enemy. 
* An [[Terminology#Attack]] that rolls [[Skills#Doubles]], is always considered a called attack.
* Called attacks consider [[Armour#Critical Weakness]].
* Called attacks cause 2 additional [[Injury#Injury Damage]], if they cause any.
* Any other narrative effects based on the details of the attack. 
* A called attack **cannot** be used to circumvent [[Armour#Armour Integrity]].


## Taking Damage
If you fail to mitigate an incoming attack, you will take damage.
[[Armour]] is your first line of defence against attacks. Your armour provides you with a small amount of [[Armour#Armour Integrity]] which can absorb incoming damage. 

* Adjust incoming damage based on if you have [[Armour#Weakness and Resistance]] to the attack.
* Deduct incoming damage from your [[Armour#Armour Integrity]].
* Any remaining damage is converted to [[Injury]].

> Example, if your character takes 3 damage from a piercing attack while wearing armour weak to piercing with 2 [[Armour#Armour Integrity]]. Your character's Armour Integrity is reduced to 0, with 3 damage still left unaccounted for, you suffer 3 [[Injury#Injury Damage]].
