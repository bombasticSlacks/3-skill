# Weapons
Weapons are tools of harm. Weapons should be a mixture of simple and unique to be found and experienced.

## Damage
Weapons cause a certain amount of harm. This is an abstraction of how capable it is of killing or damaging another thing.

## Extra Damage Modifier
Almost all weapons are capable of, with skill, dealing additional damage to other [[Terminology#Character]]. This is the penalty the weapon has to cause [[Attacks#Extra Damage]].

## Damage Type
Weapons can usually have any of the physical damage types [[Injury#Piercing]], [[Injury#Rending]], [[Injury#Impact]]. This will affect what injuries it will cause and what armour will defend against it. Fabrics tend to be strong against [[Injury#Impact]], plates against [[Injury#Rending]], and weaves against [[Injury#Piercing]]. 

## Range
Weapons, unless specified, can only be used to attack things in [[Movement#Reach]]. Some traits may give a weapon a specific range, however.



## [[Weapon-Traits]]
Abilities or unique effects a weapon might possess. If you have an idea in mind as a player or game master, try to come up with a unique trait to properly represent a weapon.  A non-exhaustive list is provided [[Weapon-Traits|here]]. 

## Quality
Weapons come in various qualities. Higher quality weapons require specific [[Combat-Training|Combat Training]] to use. For more details on how quality effects a weapon, you can look at [[Designing-Weapons#Quality]]
