# Weapons
Weapons are tools of harm. Weapons should be a mixture of simple and unique to be found and experienced.

## Damage
Weapons cause a certain amount of harm. This is an abstraction of how capable it is of killing or damaging another thing.

## Extra Damage Modifier
Almost all weapons are capable of, with skill, dealing additional damage to other [Characters](Game/Core/Terminology#Character). This is the penalty the weapon has to cause [Extra Damage](Game/Core/Attacks#Extra%20Damage).

## Damage Type
Weapons can usually have any of the physical damage types [Piercing](Injury#Piercing), [Rending](Injury#Rending), [Impact](Injury#Impact). This will affect what injuries it will cause and what armour will defend against it. Fabrics tend to be strong against [Impact](Injury#Impact), plates against [Rending](Injury#Rending), and weaves against [Piercing](Injury#Piercing). 

## Range
Weapons, unless specified, can only be used to attack things in [Reach](Movement#Reach). Some traits may give a weapon a specific range, however.



## [Weapon-Traits](Weapon-Traits)
Abilities or unique effects a weapon might possess. If you have an idea in mind as a player or game master, try to come up with a unique trait to properly represent a weapon.  A non-exhaustive list is provided [here](Weapon-Traits). 

## Quality
Weapons come in various qualities. Higher quality weapons require specific [Combat Training](Combat-Training) to use. For more details on how quality effects a weapon, you can look at [Designing Weapons](Designing-Weapons#Quality)
