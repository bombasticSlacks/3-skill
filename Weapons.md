# Weapons
Weapons can normally be separated into 3 categories: Basic, artisan and exotic. Anyone can use a basic or artisan weapon without difficulty. Exotic weapons would require [additional training](Rogue#Exotic%20Expert) or attacks will be at a -3.

Weapons should be a mixture of simple and unique to be found and experienced.

## Damage Bonus
Weapons have a damage bonus, used to calculate how much [Damage](Terminology#Damage) they do. See [Calculating Damage](Attacks#Calculating%20Damage).

### Calculating Damage
[Damage Bonus](#Damage%20Bonus) can be converted to an actual damage value as follows:

| Damage Bonus | Damage | Heavy Strike Penalty |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| 1-5          | 1      | $Damage\ Bonus - 6$    |
| 6-10         | 2      | $Damage\ Bonus - 11$    |
| 11-15        | 3      | $Damage\ Bonus - 16$    |
| 16+          | 4      | -                    | 

Damage bonus usually includes your Strength, along with bonuses from the item you are wielding, this value generally doesn't change. You should also figure out what your [Heavy Strike](#Heavy%20Strike) penalty is.

Damage is usually written as X(-Y) where X is the damage dealt and Y is the [Heavy Strike](Attacks#Heavy%20Strike) penalty.

> So if a character with 3 strength wields a melee weapon with a damage bonus of 5, they have a total damage bonus of 8. This means that their weapon deals 2 damage and their [Heavy Strike](#Heavy%20Strike) penalty is (-3), or 2(-3).

## Damage Type
Weapons can usually have any of the physical damage types [Piercing](Injury#Piercing), [Rending](Injury#Rending), [Impact](Injury#Impact). This will affect what injuries it will cause and what armour will defend against it. Fabrics tend to be strong against [Impact](Injury#Impact), plates against [Rending](Injury#Rending), and weaves against [Piercing](Injury#Piercing). 

## Range
Weapons, unless specified, can only be used to attack things in [Reach](Movement#Reach). Some traits may give a weapon a specific range, however.

## Threat
A measure of how dangerous and threatening a weapon is. Used to weight who unintelligent monsters target at random as well as makes it harder to fight with ranged weapons when [In Melee](Effects#In%20Melee).
* A character that is unarmed still has a base threat of 1. 
* A character that is unconscious or otherwise detained should have a threat of 0.

## [Weapon-Traits](Weapon-Traits)
Abilities or unique effects a weapon might possess. If you have an idea in mind as a player or game master, try to come up with a unique trait to properly represent a weapon.  A non-exhaustive list is provided [here](Weapon-Traits). 

## Quality
Weapons come in various qualities. Higher quality weapons require specific [Combat Training](Combat-Training) to use. For more details on how quality effects a weapon, you can look at [Designing Weapons](Designing-Weapons#Quality)
