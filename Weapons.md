# Weapons
Weapons can normally be separated into 3 categories: Basic, artisan and exotic. Anyone can use a basic or artisan weapon without difficulty. Exotic weapons would require [additional training](Rogue#Exotic%20Expert) or attacks will be at a -3.

Weapons should be a mixture of simple and unique to be found and experienced.

## Damage Bonus
Weapons have a damage bonus, used to calculate how much [Damage](Terminology#Damage) they do. See [Calculating Damage](Attacks#Calculating%20Damage).

## Size
Weapons, like all items, come in various sizes. However, in the case of weapons, an item's size has more effect than just the required storage space. 
- A weapon's $size \times 2$ is added to its [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus)
- Weapons of size 1-2 require one hand
- Weapons of size 3-4 require two hands
- Weapons of size 5 cannot be traditionally wielded by adventurers.

> Examples of weapon sizes are as follows:
Size 1 - Dagger, hammer, knife
Size 2 - Arming Sword, Mace, Truncheon
Size 3 - Long sword, Warhammer, Spear
Size 4 - Lance, Great Sword
Size 5 - Giant Weapons

> So, for example, a long sword is a size 3 weapon. This means it is two-handed, gets +6 damage bonus.

## Damage Type
Weapons can usually have any of the physical damage types [Piercing](Injury#Piercing), [Rending](Injury#Rending), [Impact](Injury#Impact). This will affect what injuries it will cause and what armour will defend against it. Fabrics tend to be strong against [Impact](Injury#Impact), plates against [Rending](Injury#Rending), and weaves against [Piercing](Injury#Piercing). 

## Range
Weapons, unless specified, can only be used to attack things in [Reach](Movement#Reach). Some traits may give a weapon a specific range however.

## Threat
A measure of how dangerous and threatening a weapon is. Used to weight who unintelligent monsters target at random as well as makes it harder to fight with ranged weapons when [In Melee](Effects#In%20Melee).
* A character that is unarmed still has a base threat of 1. 
* A character that is unconscious or otherwise detained should have a threat of 0.

## [Weapon-Traits](Weapon-Traits)
Abilities or unique effects a weapon might possess. If you have an idea in mind as a player or game master, try to come up with a unique trait to properly represent a weapon.  Traits can either count as 1 or 2 traits towards a weapon's total, depending on how powerful the trait is. A non-exhaustive list is provided [here](Weapon-Traits). 

## Quality
Weapons come in various qualities. Higher quality weapons require specific [Combat Training](Combat-Training) to use. For more details on how quality effects a weapon, you can look at [Designing Weapons](Designing-Weapons#Quality)
