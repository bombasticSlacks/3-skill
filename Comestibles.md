# Comestibles
Comestible consists of anything that the character will exhaust with use.

## Munitions
Weapons with a [Capacity](Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X,%20Type)) will require munitions of some kind. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons.

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus).

## Throwables
A less sophisticated solution to ranged attacks, sometimes weapons or items are designed to be thrown. 

As with [Ammunition](#Ammunition), specialized throwables exist either with larger damage bonuses, specialized effects or changed damage type.

## Alchemy
