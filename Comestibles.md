# Comestibles
Comestible consists of anything that the character will exhaust with use.

## Munitions
Some weapons with a [Capacity](Terminology#Capacity) will require munitions of some kind. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons.

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus).

## Throwables
A less sophisticated solution to ranged attacks, sometimes weapons or items are designed to be thrown. 

As with [Ammunition](#Ammunition), specialized throwables exist either with larger damage bonuses, specialized effects or changed damage type.

## Salvaging
When you use munitions and it results in a [Mitigated Attack](Terminology#Mitigated%20Attack), there is a 50% chance that the ammunition is salvageable. This can be calculated by rolling a d6, on a 1-3 the ammo is destroyed, on a 4-6 the ammo is lootable.
