# Gear
Generalist equipment characters need to perform activities and skill tests or otherwise help their characters. 

## Handling Gear
Unless specified, gear should be handled narratively. Reliable gear that isn’t otherwise damaged or displaced can be reused, temporary things like torches usually can’t.

Also, unless specified, it is assumed most gear will still require you to perform a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) of some kind. The gear facilitates or aids with actions that would otherwise be impossible, it doesn't make them guaranteed.

## Toolkits
Toolkits are a type of gear that abstracts a collection of tools necessary for a certain activity meaning a character doesn't need to be as concerned with tracking really specific items on their character sheet. This doesn't mean a character with a *specific* item can't do a skill test or action with a specific item that they've obtained narratively just that a tool kit would have made it much easier.

### Charges
An abstracted count of the number of times an item can be used. If charges are written as Charges(X), then the item has X charges.

> Example: a tool kit has Charges(3) charges, means it can be used 3 times.

These can be replaced when finding relevant materials, or by purchasing charges.
