# Gear
Generalist equipment characters need to perform activities and skill tests or otherwise help their characters. 

## Handling Equipment
Unless specified, gear should be handled narratively. Reliable gear that isn’t otherwise damaged or displaced can be reused, temporary things like torches usually can’t.

## Toolkits
Toolkits are a type of gear that abstracts a collection of tools necessary for a certain activity meaning a character doesn't need to be as concerned with tracking really specific items on their character sheet. This doesn't mean a character with a *specific* item can't do a skill test or action with a specific item that they've obtained narratively just that a tool kit would have made it much easier.

### Charges
An abstracted count of the number of times an item can be used. If charges are written as Charges(X), then the item has X charges.

> Example: a tool kit has Charges(3) charges, means it can be used 3 times.

These can be replaced when finding relevant materials, or by purchasing charges.
