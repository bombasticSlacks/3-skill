# Gear
Generalist equipment characters need to perform activities and skill tests or otherwise help their characters. 

## Handling Gear
Unless specified, gear should be handled narratively. Reliable gear that isn’t otherwise damaged or displaced can be reused, temporary things like torches usually can’t.

## Traits
These are some of the traits gear might have used as shorthand for certain effects or uses.

### Unskilled
Gear that doesn't require skill to operate will be marked with "unskilled". It is assumed most gear will otherwise still require you to perform a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) of some kind. Generally, gear facilitates or aids with actions that would otherwise be impossible, it doesn't make them guaranteed. Even gear marked as unskilled may, if used in unorthodox ways, still require a skill test.

> Feeding someone medicine doesn't require a skill test, but modifying it with other medicines and tools would even if the medicine is marked as "unskilled".

### Toolkits
Toolkits are a type of gear that abstracts a collection of tools necessary for a certain activity meaning a character doesn't need to be as concerned with tracking really specific items on their character sheet. This doesn't mean a character with a *specific* item can't do a skill test or action with a specific item that they've obtained narratively just that a tool kit would have made it much easier.

### Charges
An abstracted count of the number of times an item can be used. If charges are written as Charges(X), then the item has X charges.

> Example: a tool kit has Charges(3) charges, means it can be used 3 times.

These can be replaced when finding relevant materials, or by purchasing charges.

### Free Action
Using this gear doesn't require any time to pass.

### Comestibles
Covers any type of gear that is destroyed or made useless by using. The act of using a comestible destroys it. There are a few specialized categories of comestible:
#### Munitions
Weapons with a [Capacity](Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X,%20Type)) will require munitions of some kind. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons.

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus).

#### Throwables
A less sophisticated solution to ranged attacks, sometimes weapons or items are designed to be thrown. 

As with [Ammunition](#Ammunition), specialized throwables exist either with larger damage bonuses, specialized effects or changed damage type.

#### Drugs and Elixirs
