# Gear
Generalist equipment characters need to perform activities and skill tests or otherwise help their characters. 

## Handling Gear
Unless specified, gear should be handled narratively. Reliable gear that isn’t otherwise damaged or displaced can be reused, temporary things like torches usually can’t.

## Traits
These are some of the traits gear might have used as shorthand for certain effects or uses.
