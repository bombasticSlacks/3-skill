## Types Of Skill Tests

Skill tests come in a few various types.
### Fixed Difficulty
A standard skill test, will have a negative assigned, and it will be either pass or fail. These are written as SKILL Fixed Difficulty(+/- VALUE). If no value is mentioned in brackets, the skill test is assumed to have no bonus or negative to the roll.

> So a [Confidence](Communication#Confidence) [Fixed Difficulty(-1)](#Fixed%20Difficulty) would be a communication skill test with a -1 to the roll, [Physique](Strength#Physique) [Fixed Difficulty(0)](#Fixed%20Difficulty) would be a strike skill test with no additional penalty.

### Variable Difficulty
This is a test where you will receive more information or success based on how well you do. Variable difficulty skill tests care about your [Step Of Success](#Step)

> An example is collecting flowers, your character may get additional flowers based on their number of steps. 

### Step
When talking about variable difficulties, rules may reference step your steps. A step of success is 1 additional on your dice roll above what was required, 4 steps of success is a “14”. A step of failure is 1 less on your dice roll above what was required. 

### Opposed Difficulty
A standard skill test, however since the skill test is directed at a certain thing their expertise/resistance to the effect will influence the difficulty. Generally, this means the skill test will have an additional penalty equal to the target's relevant [Character Skills](#Character%20Skills) ranks, this will not include their attribute, but a high attribute character could provide an additional -1 penalty on the test.

### Project
Sometimes a character will fail an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) in a [Scene](Terminology#Scene) but really want to succeed or move forward with the goal. In this case the [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character) may opt to make the [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) into a Project by spending a [Power](Game/Core/Blocks/Power). In this case the [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology.md#Game%20Master) and [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology.md#Player%20Character) should work together to determine why the player failed in the first place, this could be because the character lacks all the information, tools, or materials they need to complete the current action.

> Examples of projects would be, sweet-talking a guard captain into letting you have their troops, powering a device to destroy a magic barrier, coordinating the plan of attack for a massive battle, identifying a creature you are hunting. Treating a king who has come down with a mystery illness.

The [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology.md#Game%20Master) then decides on the difficulty of the project, whether it requires 1, 2, or 3 resolutions to complete. Then in the course of the game the players may use materials, tools, and additional storytelling to complete resolutions. 

If the number of resolutions is met, the [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) may complete the project. There is no additional skill test required, after all the initial work, the project will succeed.

> As an example, say a hunter is trying to identify the creature that has been slaughtering farmers' cows. He has [Understanding](Intelligence#Understanding) and knowledge of monsters, though he doesn't have many clues to go on yet. After witnessing the injuries on the cows, he makes a skill test to see if he knows of the creature and fails. He really wants to know about the creature and so turns this into a project. The GM determines this is a 1 resolution project. To work on resolving this he needs more info he decides to go into town to ask about strange occurrences.
> After some additional narrative time, the hunter discovers that the creature had avoided a woman wearing a lot of silver jewellery, the GM considers this to be a resolution and lets the player complete the project. 
> As a reward for completion the GM provides the hunter with the information that it is a Werewolf and the abilities and attributes of the creature.

### Aid and Hindrance
When multiple characters are all attempting to perform the same task together, instead of each performing a skill task separately, the [Most Skilled](Terminology#Most%20Skilled) of the group performs the skill test and receives a +1 for each person who is [Trained](Terminology#Trained) and aiding them. Similarly, they receive a -1 for each person who isn’t [Trained](Terminology#Trained) and is part of the activity. 

> So, if two trained doctors attempt first aid, the better makes a skill test with an additional +1. 
> If 5 characters are attempting to sneak past a guard and 2 are trained and 3 are not, then the skill test is at an additional -2 (+1, -3).

### Untrained
Any untrained skill test is at an additional -2.

> Examples would be trying to spot enemies with [Understanding](Intelligence#Understanding), or jumping across a ledge with [Physique](Strength#Physique). 

### Critical Failure
Rolling double 1's on a skill test is always considered a failure.

### Critical Success
Rolling double 6's on a skill test is always considered a success. If you wouldn't otherwise have succeeded, you are considered to have 0 [Step Of Success](#Step) on the skill test.

## Doubles
If you roll two identical values on a skill test (1,1), (2,2)… (6,6) this is considered doubles. Some [Actions](Terminology#Action) special rules may reference Doubles.
