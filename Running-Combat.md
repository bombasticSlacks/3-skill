# Running Combat
{: .no_toc }

When running combat as a [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master) you have two objectives:
1. To remove the [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character) resources.
2. To challenge the [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character).

You should avoid any automatic kills or disables, focusing instead on using the games tools to chip away at resources like [Armour Integrity](Game/Core/Armour#Armour%20Integrity). 

## Suggestions
* If a character must perform back to back actions, like if they are the only enemy in the fight you should, if possible, make sure they do a different action against a different target.
* If the players are winning or severely losing feel free to adjust the current [Overwhelming Odds](Game/Core/Combat#Overwhelming%20Odds).
* Don't attack, or try to kill [Defeated](Game/Core/Effects#Defeated) [Player Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Player%20Character). Even a blood thirsty monster might start dragging them back to their layer instead of focusing on killing an incapacitated creature. Similarly an intelligent or spiteful monster may try to use a wounded player as a bargaining chip to escape.
