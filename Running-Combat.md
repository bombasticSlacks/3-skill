# Running Combat
{: .no_toc }

When running combat as a [[Terminology#Game Master]] you have two objectives:
1. To remove the [[Terminology#Player Character]] resources.
2. To challenge the [[Terminology#Player Character]].

You should avoid any automatic kills or disables, focusing instead on using the games tools to chip away at resources like [[Armour#Armour Integrity]]. 

## Suggestions
* If a character must perform back to back actions, like if they are the only enemy in the fight you should, if possible, make sure they do a different action against a different target.
* If the players are winning or severely losing feel free to adjust the current [[Combat#Overwhelming Odds]].
* Don't attack, or try to kill [[Effects#Defeated]] [[Terminology#Player Character]]. Even a blood thirsty monster might start dragging them back to their layer instead of focusing on killing an incapacitated creature. Similarly an intelligent or spiteful monster may try to use a wounded player as a bargaining chip to escape.
