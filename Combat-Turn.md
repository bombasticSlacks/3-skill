# Combat Turn
In combat, a turn is a [Character's](#Character) portion of the round. What they are doing is happening in parallel with everyone else, but for simplicity the game takes things in an order determined by [Initiative Value](Combat#Initiative%20Value). On Your turn in combat, you can do basically anything that can feasibly be done in 5 seconds. You are encouraged to get creative and talk to the GM; however, several common scenarios are provided to use as an example. The simple way to think about it though is on your turn, you:
1. [Move](Movement).
2. Do an [Action](Terminology#Action).
## Delay
When you delay your combat turn, you can instead choose to act after any other character has finished their combat turn. You need to use your delayed action before your next combat turn (this can lead to you taking back to back turns).

## Advanced Turns
There are some advanced things that may become available to you as your character develops that require you to do other things on your turn.

### Free Actions
Such as imbibing medicine, declaring combat stances, talking, etc. These free actions need to (unless otherwise specified) be performed before your action.

### Control Followers
If you have a [Follower](Terminology#Follower) they will usually act on your turn. During your turn you can select in what order you all act. However, after starting a character's turn you must finish it before moving on to another character.
