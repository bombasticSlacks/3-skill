# Spirit

The act of transcending your human limitations and connecting to something outside yourself. This includes:
* Performing magical rituals.
* Interfacing with magical locations or structures.
* Psychic powers.
* Instantaneous magic.
* Using magic items.


Any time you are trying to connect to the world around you or bend reality to your will, you should make an spirit [[Skills|Skill]] test.
