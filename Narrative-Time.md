# Narrative Time
{: .no_toc }

Narrative time involves characters in a place of interest doing activities, exploring, and progressing the story directly. The passage of narrative time can be a bit more ambiguous compared with [Combat](Game/Core/Combat). There arenâ€™t rules for narrative time, this is when characters will be directing the focus and the story themselves, doing [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action), and roleplaying.
