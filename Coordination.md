# Coordination

The act of being comfortable and accurate in how you interact with the world around you. This includes:
* Shooting ranged weapons.
* Meticulous manual work.
* Moving Silently.
* Hiding.
* Dancing.
* Acrobatics.
* Balancing.

Any time you are doing something that would require coordination or precision, you should make an coordination [[Skills|Skill]] test.
