# How To Play
This game takes place with people controlled [[Terminology#Player Character]] interacting with a world designed by a [[Terminology#Game Master]].

* [[How-To-Play]] explains the basics of the rules, you should be mindful of changing these rules as they are fundamental to the game.
* [[Telling-The-Story]] explains more advanced concepts like injury, combat, rules in telling the story are more flexible.
* Guidelines for the [[Terminology#Game Master]] are provided in [[Running-The-Game|Running The Game]].

## Dice
![[Game/Core/Content/dice-icons.svg]]
Every [[Terminology#Action]] is resolved by rolling 2d6 + modifier. In every case, there will be a relevant [[Skills|Skill]] and [[Attributes|Attribute]] associated with the action being attempted. To obtain your modifier
$$skill\ value + stat\ value - difficulty = modifier$$ 
Difficulty is assigned by the GM and defaults to 0. After determining the modifier, you then roll. 
* If roll + modifier >= 10 you succeed.
* Otherwise, you fail.
* Players should not get to make skill tests for impossible actions.

Common modifiers include: rushed (-1), high pressure (-1), non-trivial (-1), complicated task (-2), challenging (-3), hellish task (-5), impossible task (-7). [[Skills]] will also provide some examples.

## Things To Remember

### Say Yes
The rules provided within this section are not supposed to be exhaustive. This is a set of guidelines to give players and game masters an idea of what is possible, and how it should be determined. Generally, you should try to never say “no” to a player's impulse. You should inform them of the difficulty of a task and from there they can make an informed decision on if they want to progress.

### Rule In Player Favour
If a rule is ambiguous or leads to confusion between [[#The Players|The Players]] and the [[#GM|GM]], in the moment you should always interpret in the way that is best for the players. When time permits you can discuss how the rule will be handled in the future which may not be as beneficial for the players, with the [[#GM|GM]] having final say and potentially setting [House Rules](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules).
