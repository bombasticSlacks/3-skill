# How To Play
## The Players
The players, characters, heroes, adventurers etc. refers to the group of people that the players playing the game control directly. They will have motivations, plans, ideas, abilities, and be directed by the players themselves.

## GM
The GM, or, game master is the person who directs the flow of the game. They set up the initial state of the world, potentially with help from the players, then control every non-player character and entity in it.

More guidelines for the GM are provided in [Running The Game](Running-The-Game).

## Dice
![dice-icons](Content/dice-icons.svg)
Every [Action](Terminology#Action) is resolved by rolling 2d6 + modifier. In every case, there will be a relevant [Skill](Skills) and [Attribute](Attributes) associated with the action being attempted. To obtain your modifier
$$skill\ value + stat\ value - difficulty = modifier$$ 
Difficulty is assigned by the GM and defaults to 0. After determining the modifier, you then roll. 
* If roll + modifier >= 10 you succeed.
* Otherwise, you fail.
* Players should not get to make skill tests for impossible actions.

Common modifiers include: rushed (-1), high pressure (-1), non-trivial (-1), complicated task (-2), challenging (-3), hellish task (-5), impossible task (-7). [Skills](Skills) will also provide some examples.

## Things To Remember

### Say Yes
The rules provided within this section are not supposed to be exhaustive. This is a set of guidelines to give players and game masters an idea of what is possible, and how it should be determined. Generally, you should try to never say “no” to a player's impulse. You should inform them of the difficulty of a task and from there they can make an informed decision on if they want to progress.

### Rule In Player Favour
If a rule is ambiguous or leads to confusion between [The Players](#The%20Players) and the [GM](#GM), in the moment you should always interpret in the way that is best for the players. When time permits you can discuss how the rule will be handled in the future which may not be as beneficial for the players, with the [GM](#GM) having final say and potentially setting [House Rules](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules).
