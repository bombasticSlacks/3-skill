# Special Combat Actions
In combat there are several situations that come up often enough they should have predefined rules. This doesn't mean this list is exhaustive, but should give an idea of the sort of things you can do in combat apart from harming someone directly.

## Defensive Fighting
You may as a free action make a [Grace](Agility#Grace) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0) if successful, no one can perform [Attack of Opportunity](Game/Core/Reacting#Attack%20of%20Opportunity) against you during this turn. If you fail, anyone [In Melee](Game/Core/Effects#In%20Melee) may immediately perform an [Attack of Opportunity](Game/Core/Reacting#Attack%20of%20Opportunity).

## Cautious Step
As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) may move without suffering [Attack of Opportunity](Game/Core/Reacting#Attack%20of%20Opportunity), but can do nothing else.

## Disarm
With at least one free hand or a melee weapon, you can attempt to disarm a [Character](Terminology#Character) within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) of you. Make a [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill test at (-1) and if successful, your opponent drops their weapon (or it is now in your hands).

### Grapple
Make an attack against someone within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) with the intent of getting control of your opponent. If this is a [Non-mitigated Attack](Terminology#Non-mitigated%20Attack), your opponent is in a grapple. 
As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action), they may:
* Attempt an [Athletics](Strength#Athletics) [Opposed Difficulty](Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty) skill test to become the grappler, instead of the grappled. This test is opposed by the grapplers [Athletics](Strength#Athletics)
* Attempt a [Grace](Agility#Grace) [Opposed Difficulty](Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty) skill test to stop being grappled. This test is opposed by the grapplers [Athletics](Strength#Athletics).

As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action), you may:
* [Athletics](Game/Core/Strength#Athletics) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0) to cause 2 [Impact](Game/Core/Injury#Impact) damage.
* Pin your [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) completely, causing them to take a -2 on any skill tests on their turn.
* Make an attack with a size 1 weapon with a (-2) to hit that canâ€™t be evaded
* Make an [Athletics](Strength#Athletics) skill test to throw them [Close](Game/Core/Movement#Close) in a direction of your choice.

## Parry
Which is a [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill test at (-2) where if you succeed, then if an enemy attacks you [in melee](#Being%20in%20Melee%20Combat) and succeeds, you ignore the attack. If they fail their skill test to attack, you may make an attack on them without requiring a skill test.

## Shove
With at least one free hand, you can attempt to move someone within [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) of you. Make a [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill test, if you succeed, you can move them somewhere [Close](Game/Core/Movement#Close).
