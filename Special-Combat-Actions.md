# Special Combat Actions
In combat there are several situations that come up often enough they should have predefined rules. This doesn't mean this list is exhaustive, but should give an idea of the sort of things you can do in combat apart from harming someone directly.

## Defensive Fighting
You may as a free action make a [[Coordination]] if successful, no one can perform an attack against you during your turn. If you fail, someone [[In-Melee]] may immediately perform an [[Terminology#Attack]] against you.

## Cautious Step
As an [[Terminology#Action]] may move without suffering any [[Terminology#Attack]], but can do nothing else during your [[Terminology#Action]].

## Disarm
With at least one free hand or a melee weapon, you can attempt to disarm a [[Terminology#Character]] within [[Movement#Reach]] of you. Make a [[Physique]] skill test at (-1) and if successful, your opponent drops their weapon (or it is now in your hands).

### Grapple
Make an attack against someone within [[Movement#Reach]] with the intent of getting control of your opponent. If this is a [[Terminology#Non-mitigated Attack]], your opponent is in a grapple. 
As an [[Terminology#Action]], they may:
* Attempt an [[Physique]] skill test to become the grappler, instead of the grappled. This test is opposed by the grapplers [[Physique]].
* Attempt a [[Coordination]] skill test to stop being grappled. This test is opposed by the grapplers [[Physique]].

As an [[Terminology#Action]], you may:
* [[Physique]] to cause 2 [[Injury#Impact]] damage.
* Pin your [[Terminology#Opponent]] completely, causing them to take a -2 on any skill tests on their turn.
* Make an [[Terminology#Action]] with a size 1 weapon with a (-2) to hit that can’t be evaded
* Make an [[Physique]] skill test to throw them [[Movement#Close]] in a direction of your choice.

## Shove
With at least one free hand, you can attempt to move someone within [[Movement#Reach]] of you. Make a [[Physique]] skill test, if you succeed, you can move them somewhere [[Movement#Close]].
